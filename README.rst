kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.

The library builds on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided
by the HyperSpy library. An effort is made to keep memory usage in check and
enable scalability by using the Dask library for pattern processing.

The project is in an alpha stage, and there will likely be breaking changes with
each release.

kikuchipy is released under the GPLv3+ license.
